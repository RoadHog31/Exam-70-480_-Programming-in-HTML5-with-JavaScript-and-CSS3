/* HTML Events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements. 

A lot start with on*/

var evnt = window.event;

/* NOTE    ACCESSING THE EVENT CONTEXT
In Internet Explorer, the window event is the method required to access the event ob-ject. However, in some browsers, the event object is passed to the event function as a parameter */

function name(param)
