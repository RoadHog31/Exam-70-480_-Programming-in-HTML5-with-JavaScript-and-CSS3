/* Objective 2.4: Implement a callback  

The primary object that you will work with is the WebSocket object, which connects to the socket when its constructor is invoked. In Listing 2.1, a variable is declared but not instanti-ated until a user invokes the connect button. When the user clicks the button, the WebSocketis instantiated with the appropriate connection information:wsConnection=  new WebSocket('ws://studygroup.70480.com', ['soap', 'xmpp']);

TheWebSocket constructor accepts two parameters: 

	*The URL of the server-side socket to connect to, which is always prefixed with ws or wss for secure WebSocket connections. 

	*An optional list of subprotocols

When the WebSocket constructor is called, the WebSocket API establishes a connection to the server. One of two things can happen at this stage. The WebSocket will successfully connect to the server or the connection will fail, resulting in an error. B*/
