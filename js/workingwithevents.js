// Events provide the spark to the JavaScript engine.An event takes place at a point in time.For JavaScript, an event most commonly occurs with user interaction but also occurs when something changes state, such as a video starting or stopping.For example, the user points to an image, clicks a button, or tabs from one text box to another.The DOM provides events to give the developer the ability to subscribe to the event and execute code.
// Events are based on the publisher - subscriber design pattern.
